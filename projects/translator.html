        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <div class="overview-informations">
            <p>This Project was created while I was working for MCQ TECH GmbH <a href="http://metz-connect.com" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Being international it was necessary to internationalise their intranet and its applications.</p>
            <p>
                Since Zikula uses gettext for internationalisation and the only ways to translate a page to different languages were:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Writing a translation catalogue and translate it by hand and then compile it with a tool like Poedit.</li>
                    <li>Generate the transation catalogue, translate and compile it with a tool like Poedit.</li>
                    <li>Use the Zikula Gettext Module, which generates the translation catalogue for you after you zipped your module and uploaded it. To translate and compile it, a tool like Poedit is needed.</li>
                </ul>
                But writing a translation catalogue by hand is too error prone and setting up an external tool to find every gettext occurrence can be quite time consuming.
                Using the Zikula Gettext Module seems like a bad idea, since you have to first zip your module and upload it to get a translation catalogue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea to this module was to make the use of external tools obsolete by giving the developer a tool at hand that makes it possible to generate the translation catalogue, translate it and finally compile it.
                To make this possible it searches for gettext-functions in the selected module and saves them for translation.
                After translation the translation catalogue can be exported and gets compiled with help of the PHP package php.mo <a href="https://github.com/phpmo/php.mo"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
            </p>
            <p class="urgent">
                Since much of the development of this project was done during my work for MCQ TECH, the further development is currently on a halt.
                I started some major changes on the module, that are still unfinished because other projects with higher priority blocked the development.
                Until I find the muse and the time to build a working test-environment and work on it.
