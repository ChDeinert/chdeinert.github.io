        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <div class="overview-informations">
            <p>This project is an WiP extraction of an important part of the <a href="/projects/translator.html">Translator</a> Module I created for the Zikula-Application Framework.</p>
            <p>
                The goal is to create a Framework agnostic PHP Package with the Logic that enables the work with the Gettext Po Files which the <a href="/projects/translator.html">Translator</a> Module uses.
                Also it enables me to Test more of the logic <i>inside</i> the Zikula Module.
            </p>
            <p>
                But since the development on the Module was on a hold for quite some time and I could learn a lot, I decided to write this Package from scratch.
                Doing this I looked at what it needs an planned accordingly.
                This means it is currently not really operational, its still a Work in Progress, but the most basic things are already working.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is still a lot to do, for it to become a good Package,
                but I will keep on it and update this Site as soon as there is something interesting about it.
