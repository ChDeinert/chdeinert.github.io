    <h2>About me</h2>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>I'm a FrontEnd Software Developer mainly using Node.js, React and Sass.<br />I constantly learn new stuff and I love to take a look beyond the tellerrand now and then.</p>
    <p>Before I started my specialization towards the FrontEnd, was working close to 10 years as an 'Informatikkaufmann' (IT Management Assistant is the official translation I think) doing FullStack Development with PHP (60-70% of my time) while also doing IT-Administration and Support.<br />During that time I also made my B.Sc. in Applied Computer Science in my free time...<br />Shortly after I finished my Bachelor went on and found the position I'm currently in (may 2016).</p>
    <p>Also I'm playing Handball, PC Games and am an amateur photographer.</p>
